        <h4>INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING THE LASER CUTTER</h4>
        <p>
            First of all it is needed to be remember that the vacumn should be on once the laser cutter is activated. This prevent the fire accident that can happen due to the heat that the laser creates when is cutting the different materials. Once the laser cutter is activated and the material that is going to be cut is in place, we need to select the point where the laser cutter will begin to cut the pieces.It is important to choose a point close to the edge of the material, otherwise it would be lot of waste.
            Most of the times it is recommmended to test the power of the laser because it will need different power to cut different materials. A simple figure like a square can be scket and cut in the laser cutter in the material that is going to be use later to create the piece to test if the power and speed of the laser cutter is enough to cut the material.
            The second step is to select the height of the laser for that there is a piece with the shape of a triangule that can be placed next to laser. When this piece is barely touching the surface of the material that is going to be cut, the height of the laser is in place.
            Then it is time to make the last ajustments before cutting the piece. We have to make sure that the laser will start cutting in the top left corner and select the lines and give them a colour of our choice so the laser cutter nknow which lines should be completily cut and which ones should be marked. The different colours will be asociated to a different power.
            The the cutting can begin. <b>Don't forget to turn on the vacumn.</b>
