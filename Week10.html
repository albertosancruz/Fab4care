        <h1>SOFT ROBOTICS</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
             During this lecture, we counted with the presence of a fashion designer from Amsterdam, who specializes on soft robotics, as well as with the director of the Fablab of Auckland, New Zealand
        </p>
        <p>
            To be able to create it, the required materials were:
        </p>
        <p>
            First it is needed a model that is going to be 3D printed, casting with separation air chambers. This casting will allow the air go through the softrobotic and inflate it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we are going to mix the sillicon. There two different types of sillicon RTV 22 and RTV145. The mix should have an equal amount of both sillicons and then the mixture is going to be ixed with a stick for a couple of minutes until is uniform. After mixing the components colour dyes can be added and mixed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Before placing the sillicon into the model it is necessary to spry it so the sillicon does not stick to it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally the mixture is placed into the model in the oven fro fifteen minutes.

    <h4>AIR SOFT ROBOTIC</h4>
    <div>
        <p>
            First of all we need to draw the design that we want to create twice in a symetrical way. To keep it simple in the Fablab instead of using a sofisticated software to design the pattern we drew it in baking paper.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the plastic is cut using the baking paper as a guide but leaving a space of two or three centimeters of margin. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The next step is to put all the pieces together inside the machine that will be presseing the pieces at a temperature of 120ºC.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally a straw is included so the body can be inflated when the air is introduced and sealed using a dryer.
