        <h2>WORKFLOW WORKING WITH EXACTFLAT</h2>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>EXACTFLAT</h4>
        <p>
            First of all an account in exactflat online it is needed to use this program. Once you have opened the account it is needed to import the figure. Then the tool Remesher, and inside Adaptive remesher with a standart quality and a maximun runtime of 5.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then the next step is Flatten. The tool Pre-flatten must be selected with the option Fracture in order to break the loops that can´t be flat in the figure. This loops are marked in purple.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once is flatten the option finish give the opprtunity to optimize the figure. Then the document need to be saved as DFX.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly we can open the DFX document in Fusion to make some patorns with the fuction scket.

        <h4>FAILURE</h4>
        <p>
            In this step I had problems using the tool Fracture because my figure had lot of loops so that's why I had to change it.
