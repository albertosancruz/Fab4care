        <h4>INITIAL IDEAS</h4>
        <p>
            The first idea is to create a glove that can reproduce movements that have been programmed. This idea came to my mind when I was thinking about how to create something related with medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example when a person breaks one hand, the doctor give some exercise to heal the hand with different movement in order to recover the mobility withouth having any problems. This exercise are easy to remember but most of the people start to forget doing it because it becomes tedius.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is to create a glove that will be in the hand during the entire day, so it must be comfortable in order to remind this movements. The glove must have vibrating sensor to indicate the patient that the exercise need to be done and then the exoskeleton of the glove will reproduce the exercise the first time so the patient know which exercise is going to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most difficult part would be the exoskeleton, which need to be comfortable to have it the hand for long time but it need to be efficient so it can reproduce the movemnt properly. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that may be the glove can have some type of material with coductibility properties to make it more discret and easy to wear and also a motor is going to be essential for the movement and the wrist is the best place to put it in my opinion because it won't bother the patient while doing daily life.
