        <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
        <p>
           The aim of a Paracanoe competition is for people to race each other in kayaks and Va'a boats over a clearly defined unobstructed course over 200 meters in the shortest possible time according to the rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            According with reglament the adaptation equipment is not regulated. It is included as part of the weight of the boat if it is securely attached. Only adaptations used during classification may be used in subsequent competitions. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The weight of the kayak can not exceed 12kg, and the weight of the Va'a can not exceed 13kg including hull, alma and iatco.
            The legnh and width of the kayak are 520 and 50, measured 10cm form the bottom of the hull, respectively.
            The lenght of the Va'a is longer 730.
        </p>
        <p>
            For making the seat of the kayak first it is needed a mold of the person that is going to use the seat, Katharina. First of all there are different possibilities to make this mold. IT can be done using the scanner which we think it is going to be the more confortable way to do it for Katharina. Once we have the shape scanned we can work with the material in order to create the seat. The material that will be ideal is the carbon fiber because it is stronger than steel but lighter than aluminium.
