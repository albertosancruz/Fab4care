        <h4>EAGLE AND GIMP</h4>
        <p>
            The sewable LED is the easiest way to incorporate lights into a textile. To create this kind of Led we are goint to use two different softwares: Eagle and Gimp. 
        </p>
        <p>
            First we are going to create the design on Eagle. This design is going to be schematic and basic, formed by two resistors and one LED connected using the tool NET. After creating the design is is necessary to place the components as close as possible. Then the components of the final design are going to be connected using the tool ROUTE.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally the design need to be exported in a format that can d¡be used in photo editor such as photoshop or in this case Gimp.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we are going to start working with Gimp. First of all we need to import the design. Then we have to select an area around the design and place the design in the center of this area. <b>Check that measures from Eagle are the same in Gimp</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then inside of the area we are going to draw another rectangule. The result is going to be two images that we are going to call LEDtraces and LEDcutout. This images are going to exported to be cutted in the CNC milling machine.

            <h5>GIMP2</h5>
        </div>
    </div>
        <p>
            In this machine we have to select the widht of the tool that is going to be used to cut and it is need to placed in the right height otherwise it will not cut the material.
